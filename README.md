# Getting Started with Amazone Crypto App

This project was bootstrapped with [React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


## App Features

If you've ever wondered what Amazon might look like using crypto, I think it would look something like this. It is deployed with [Moralis](https://moralis.io/) for login, crypto authentication, database, server storage, and crypto APIs. Crypto is used for payments and it's using MATIC Mumbai Testnet.

### `Run Locally`

    npm start
    or
    yarn start

You will need Moralis server running on MATIC Mumbai Testnet. You will also need to have a wallet with some test MATIC to use.

### `Demo`

This is a demo only, no items will be shipped!
